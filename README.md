🚀 Just launched a Real-Time Online Code Compiler! 💻⚡

Built using the MERN stack, integrated with Monaco Editor (the same editor that powers VS Code) and Socket.IO for real-time collaboration. 🔄

👨‍💻 Features:

Real-time code syncing between users

Live output execution

Language support with backend integration

Seamless developer experience with responsive UI

This project helped me dive deep into WebSockets, code execution environments, and scalable real-time architectures.

Would love your feedback or suggestions! 🔁

For Frontend
